## Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster ##

"The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## Summary ##

We start with cleaning the train data, post which we plot this data as graphs,  providing visual statistics. We then train the cleaned data set using a Random Forest Classifier. Using IPython, we plot this decision tree, following which, we clean the test data to start our prediction. Finally, we use the trained forest to make a prediction which we then write to a csv file.
